# Regula Document Reader Ionic demo application

## How to build demo application
1. Download or the clone current repository using the command `git clone https://github.com/regulaforensics/npm-document-reader.git`.

2. Execute `npm run setup` within this directory.

3. Run the app: 
  * IOS: `npm run ios`.
  * Android: `npm run android`.

**Note**: this is just one way of running the app. You can also pass `-o` or `--open` argument to the command, and this will open Xcode/Android Studio, then run the app directly from the IDE. Overall, this is a more consistent way, so if you're having troubles running the app from terminal, try running it from the IDE.
